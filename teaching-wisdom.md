# Nuggets of Wisdom from Prof Ben

* When teaching programming, we are not that interested in the model answer.
We are more interested in the process it takes to get there.
* We pick examples to illustrate concepts.
* You may not need to solve every problem,
but come to class knowing what problems we are going to solve.
* When teaching students, teach them to make connections. The answers are secondary.
